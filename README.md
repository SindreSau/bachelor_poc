# Let's start testing awesome libraries!

## How to use

1. To start working on a new feature, add a new page as well as a navlink to that page.
2. If we intend to try multiple libraries for the same feature, we can swap out the navlink with a [Navigation Menu](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/navigation-menu) component.
3. Feel free to add documentation in the code or here in the README.
